# Tenant Lease Status Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Fake Lease Status from Tenant Cards
**Problem**: Tenant cards were showing a fake "lease status" based on user status, not actual lease data.

**Solution**: 
- Completely removed the lease status section from tenant profile cards
- Tenant cards now show only essential contact and employment information
- Cleaner, more focused card design

### 2. ✅ Updated Tenant Detail View with Real Lease Information
**Problem**: The lease information section was showing generic data instead of actual lease details with property names and real lease statuses.

**Solution**:
- Replaced static lease information with dynamic lease data
- Shows actual lease status badges (Active, Pending, Expired, etc.)
- Displays property names for each lease
- Shows comprehensive lease details:
  - Property name/address
  - Lease status with color-coded badges
  - Start and end dates
  - Monthly rent amount
  - Lease duration calculation
  - Summary of active vs total leases

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Lease Display
**Features Added**:
- **Property Information**: Shows property name or address for each lease
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators (green for active, yellow for pending, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Details**: Start/end dates, rent amount, duration
- **Empty State**: Proper message when no leases exist
- **Summary Section**: Quick overview of active vs total leases

## Lease Information Display

### Before Fix
```
- Generic "lease information" with move-in dates
- Fake status based on user status
- No property names
- Limited lease details
```

## Lease Status Color Coding

- **Active**: Green badge (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
- **Pending**: Yellow badge (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800)
- **Expired**: Red badge (bg-red-100 text-red-800)
- **Terminated**: Gray badge (bg-gray-100 text-gray-800)

## Data Sources

### Lease Information Comes From:
- `leaseService.getLeases()` - Fetches all leases
- Filtered by tenant ID to show only relevant leases
- Property names from lease data (`property_name` or `property_address`)
- Real lease statuses from lease records

### Tenant Cards Show:
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Employment information (employer, position, income)
- Address information
- Move-in date (if available)
- Notes (if available)

## Testing

### Verify These Work:
1. ✅ Tenant cards no longer show fake lease status
2. ✅ Tenant detail view shows real lease information
3. ✅ Property names display correctly for each lease
4. ✅ Lease status badges show actual lease statuses
5. ✅ Lease details (dates, rent, duration) display correctly
6. ✅ Empty state shows when tenant has no leases
7. ✅ Leases tab still works with detailed lease information

### Test Scenarios:
1. View tenant with active leases → Should show property names and "Active" status
2. View tenant with multiple leases → Should show each lease separately
3. View tenant with no leases → Should show "No leases found" message
4. Check lease status colors → Should match actual lease statuses
5. Verify lease details → Dates, rent amounts, and duration should be accurate

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Tenant lease status now reflects actual lease data with property names and real statuses.
