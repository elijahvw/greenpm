# Tenant View Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Tenant Updates Not Showing on View Screen
**Problem**: Tenant field updates were working but not displaying on the tenant detail view screen.

**Root Cause**: The `getTenant` function in `tenantService.ts` was not properly transforming the backend response data to match the frontend interface.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `getTenant` function to properly map all backend fields to frontend interface
- Added proper data transformation for employment, emergency contact, and address data
- Ensured all optional fields have proper defaults

### 2. ✅ Emergency Contact Removed from Tenant Profile Card
**Problem**: Emergency contact information was taking up space in the tenant profile card and wasn't the most relevant information for quick overview.

**Solution**:
- Replaced emergency contact section with "Lease Status" information
- Shows tenant status badge and move-in date
- More relevant for landlords to see at a glance

### 3. ✅ Backend Data Consistency
**Problem**: The tenant list endpoint (`/users/tenants`) was only returning basic fields, while the individual tenant endpoint (`/users/tenants/{id}`) returned full details.

**Solution**:
- Updated tenant list endpoint to include all user fields
- Added proper data transformation for employment, emergency contact, and address
- Ensured both endpoints return consistent data structure

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes
1. **`src/services/tenantService.ts`**
   - Fixed `getTenant()` function data transformation
   - Updated `getTenants()` function to handle additional fields
   - Added proper mapping for all backend fields

2. **`src/components/Tenants/TenantCard.tsx`**
   - Removed emergency contact section
   - Added lease status section with status badge and move-in date
   - More relevant information for tenant overview

### Backend Changes
1. **`src/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`**
   - Updated `/users/tenants` endpoint to include all user fields
   - Added comprehensive data transformation for list endpoint
   - Ensured consistency between list and detail endpoints

## Data Flow

### Before Fix
```
Backend → Raw API Response → Frontend (Missing Data Transformation) → Incomplete Display
```

### After Fix
```
Backend → Complete API Response → Frontend (Proper Data Transformation) → Full Display
```

## Field Mapping

### Backend → Frontend
- `first_name` → `firstName`
- `last_name` → `lastName`
- `date_of_birth` → `dateOfBirth`
- `social_security_number` → `socialSecurityNumber`
- `move_in_date` → `moveInDate`
- `move_out_date` → `moveOutDate`
- `employer`, `position`, `monthly_income`, `employment_start_date` → `employment` object
- `emergency_contact_*` → `emergencyContact` object
- `address_line1`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `country` → `address` object

## Tenant Profile Card Changes

### Removed
- Emergency contact information (name, phone, relationship)

### Added
- Lease status badge with color coding
- Move-in date display
- More compact and relevant information

## Testing

### Verify These Work
1. ✅ Tenant detail view shows all updated fields
2. ✅ Employment information displays correctly
3. ✅ Address information displays correctly
4. ✅ Date of birth and other personal fields show
5. ✅ Tenant profile cards show lease status instead of emergency contact
6. ✅ Tenant list and detail views are consistent

### Test Scenarios
1. Edit a tenant's employment information → Should show on detail view
2. Edit a tenant's address → Should show on detail view
3. Edit a tenant's personal information → Should show on detail view
4. View tenant profile cards → Should show lease status, not emergency contact
